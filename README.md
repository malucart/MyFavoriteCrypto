### Description

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Tracking App
- **Mobile:** Mobile is a good option for this kind of app because of the mobility and easy layout.
- **Story:** Some people like to think twice before buying a new cryptocurrency, so when they read the news, they see the specific cryptoâ€™s situation in the last days, months and the last year. And after monitoring and studying the crypto, they may buy it. So the idea of this app is to track crypto, and have a page for the favorite crypto by the user.
- **Market:** Everyone who is interested in investments. 
- **Habit:** People will be constantly using this app to track their crypto, to see new crypto and to make their life easier to not search about a specific crypto outside because the app is already giving them the information they need.
- **Scope:** V1 would allow users to create their profile. V2 would be able to connect to the CoinMarketCap API. V3 would be able to save favorite items (crypto) V4 would be able to delete an item (crypto) on their favorite list.
